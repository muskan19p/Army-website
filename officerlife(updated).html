<h3><u>Life of an Indian Army Officer ---</u><h3>

		    <p>Anonyms---   
			I  have to be anonymous because we are briefed not to be on public domain. It’s been 4 years in field now. Probably i am the lucky one as i have had the dream posting, currently in Special forces. i have experienced everyday as new challenge. Night watch of the border is my personal favorite. Our job is 24*365 job. No Saturday no Sunday. During my first posting my leave was cancelled twice and i experienced the truth. Life is very organized/disciplined for us.i  have experienced some of the great heights and severe cold which nearly freezed me. Our bunkers are our home and soldiers become family.

In special forces life is much bout training, mental and physical exercise and pushing to the absolute limit. The ops are definitely tough and the administration is much strict. My jinx continues, I got leave for the 1st time in Special Force after 2 declined leaves. So i guess life cannot be explained as how it is, because for defense personnel ours is normal life and the outside world seems new. when i come home my friends ask me how is life? I don’t know how to explain it to them. For them it is how you survive and face enemy. For us it is professionalism and doing our duty, it’s daily activity and I cannot express it.

Summing up, A soldier’s life can be understood by a soldier, rest everyone does is assumption (or trying to find interesting bit in it).</p>
<h3><u>I found a poem and I think, this poem best describes the life of an army officer.</u><h3>

<pre>We both left home at 18.

You cleared JEE,
I got recommended.

You got IIT,
I got NDA.

You pursued your degree,
I had the toughest training.

Your day started at 7 and ended at 5,
Mine started at 4 till 9 and Some nights too.

You had your convocation ceremony,
I had my POP.

Best company took you with the best package,
I was ordered to join my paltan With 2 stars piped on my shoulders.

You got a job,
I got a way of life.

Every evening, you got to see your family,
I just wished I got to see my parents soon.

You celebrated festivals with lights and music,
I celebrated with my comrade in bunkers.

We both married,
Your wife got to see you every day,
My wife just wished I was alive.

You were sent on business trips,
I was sent on line of control.

We both returned,
Both wives couldn't control their tears,

but
You wiped her but,I couldn't
You hugged her but,I couldn’t

Because I was lying in the coffin,
With medals on my chest and,
Coffin wrapped with the tricolor.

My way of life ended, yours continued.
We both left home at 18.

<p>This poem clearly shows the feeling of an army officer. who sacrifices their life for the safety of the nation and for the safety of us.
A day before Diwali, this year, Captain Ashutosh Kumar scarifies his life along with three others for the nation.
“Capt. Ashutosh cleared both IIT and NDA but chose nation above himself. He could have been alive enjoying this Diwali, a ‘better’ lifestyle being an IITian but he chooses to serve the nation.”
May his soul rest in peace.</p>

<u>How is the life of an Indian Army officer after retirement?</u>
<p>Life of a retired officer is much better than the retired soldiers. All officers retire as atleast timescale colonels that too at the age of 54 compared to that of soldiers who retire after 17 years of service. The officers who retire in the rank of major general or lieutenant Gen enjoy facilities of sahayak even after retirement.</p>
